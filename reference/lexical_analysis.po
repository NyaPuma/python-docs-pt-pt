msgid "Lexical analysis"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A Python program is read by a *parser*.  Input to the parser is a stream of :"
"term:`tokens <token>`, generated by the *lexical analyzer* (also known as "
"the *tokenizer*). This chapter describes how the lexical analyzer produces "
"these tokens."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The lexical analyzer determines the program text's :ref:`encoding "
"<encodings>` (UTF-8 by default), and decodes the text into :ref:`source "
"characters <lexical-source-character>`. If the text cannot be decoded, a :"
"exc:`SyntaxError` is raised."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Next, the lexical analyzer uses the source characters to generate a stream "
"of tokens. The type of a generated token generally depends on the next "
"source character to be processed. Similarly, other special behavior of the "
"analyzer depends on the first source character that hasn't yet been "
"processed. The following table gives a quick summary of these source "
"characters, with links to sections that contain more information."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The end of a logical line is represented by the token :data:`~token."
"NEWLINE`. Statements cannot cross logical line boundaries except where :data:"
"`!NEWLINE` is allowed by the syntax (e.g., between statements in compound "

msgstr ""

msgid "Physical lines"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A physical line is a sequence of characters terminated by one the following "

msgid ""
"the Windows form using the ASCII sequence CR LF (return followed by "

"Regardless of platform, each of these sequences is replaced by a single "
"ASCII LF (linefeed) character. (This is done even inside :ref:`string "
"literals <strings>`.) Each line can use any of the sequences; they do not "
"need to be consistent within a file."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The end of input also serves as an implicit terminator for the final "
"physical line."
msgstr ""

msgid "Formally:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Comments"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A comment starts with a hash character (``#``) that is not part of a string "
"literal, and ends at the end of the physical line.  A comment signifies the "
"end of the logical line unless the implicit line joining rules are invoked. "
"Comments are ignored by the syntax."
msgstr ""

msgid "Encoding declarations"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If a comment in the first or second line of the Python script matches the "
"regular expression ``coding[=:]\\s*([-\\w.]+)``, this comment is processed "
"as an encoding declaration; the first group of this expression names the "
"encoding of the source code file. The encoding declaration must appear on a "
"line of its own. If it is the second line, the first line must also be a "
"comment-only line. The recommended forms of an encoding expression are ::"
msgstr ""

msgid "# -*- coding: <encoding-name> -*-"
msgstr ""

msgid "which is recognized also by GNU Emacs, and ::"
msgstr ""

msgid "# vim:fileencoding=<encoding-name>"
msgstr ""

msgid "which is recognized by Bram Moolenaar's VIM."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If no encoding declaration is found, the default encoding is UTF-8.  If the "
"implicit or explicit encoding of a file is UTF-8, an initial UTF-8 byte-"
"order mark (``b'\\xef\\xbb\\xbf'``) is ignored rather than being a syntax "
"error."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If an encoding is declared, the encoding name must be recognized by Python "
"(see :ref:`standard-encodings`). The encoding is used for all lexical "
"analysis, including string literals, comments and identifiers."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"All lexical analysis, including string literals, comments and identifiers, "
"works on Unicode text decoded using the source encoding. Any Unicode code "
"point, except the NUL control character, can appear in Python source."
msgstr ""

msgid "Explicit line joining"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Two or more physical lines may be joined into logical lines using backslash "
"characters (``\\``), as follows: when a physical line ends in a backslash "
"that is not part of a string literal or comment, it is joined with the "
"following forming a single logical line, deleting the backslash and the "
"following end-of-line character.  For example::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"if 1900 < year < 2100 and 1 <= month <= 12 \\\n"
"   and 1 <= day <= 31 and 0 <= hour < 24 \\\n"
"   and 0 <= minute < 60 and 0 <= second < 60:   # Looks like a valid date\n"
"        return 1"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A line ending in a backslash cannot carry a comment.  A backslash does not "
"continue a comment.  A backslash does not continue a token except for string "
"literals (i.e., tokens other than string literals cannot be split across "
"physical lines using a backslash).  A backslash is illegal elsewhere on a "
"line outside a string literal."
msgstr ""

msgid "Implicit line joining"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Expressions in parentheses, square brackets or curly braces can be split "
"over more than one physical line without using backslashes. For example::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"month_names = ['Januari', 'Februari', 'Maart',      # These are the\n"
"               'April',   'Mei',      'Juni',       # Dutch names\n"
"               'Juli',    'Augustus', 'September',  # for the months\n"
"               'Oktober', 'November', 'December']   # of the year"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Implicitly continued lines can carry comments.  The indentation of the "
"continuation lines is not important.  Blank continuation lines are allowed. "
"There is no NEWLINE token between implicit continuation lines.  Implicitly "
"continued lines can also occur within triple-quoted strings (see below); in "
"that case they cannot carry comments."
msgstr ""

msgid "Blank lines"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A logical line that contains only spaces, tabs, formfeeds and possibly a "
"comment, is ignored (i.e., no :data:`~token.NEWLINE` token is generated). "
"During interactive input of statements, handling of a blank line may differ "
"depending on the implementation of the read-eval-print loop. In the standard "
"interactive interpreter, an entirely blank logical line (that is, one "
"containing not even whitespace or a comment) terminates a multi-line "
"statement."
msgstr ""

msgid "Indentation"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Leading whitespace (spaces and tabs) at the beginning of a logical line is "
"used to compute the indentation level of the line, which in turn is used to "
"determine the grouping of statements."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Tabs are replaced (from left to right) by one to eight spaces such that the "
"total number of characters up to and including the replacement is a multiple "
"of eight (this is intended to be the same rule as used by Unix).  The total "
"number of spaces preceding the first non-blank character then determines the "
"line's indentation.  Indentation cannot be split over multiple physical "
"lines using backslashes; the whitespace up to the first backslash determines "
"the indentation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Indentation is rejected as inconsistent if a source file mixes tabs and "
"spaces in a way that makes the meaning dependent on the worth of a tab in "
"spaces; a :exc:`TabError` is raised in that case."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Cross-platform compatibility note:** because of the nature of text editors "
"on non-UNIX platforms, it is unwise to use a mixture of spaces and tabs for "
"the indentation in a single source file.  It should also be noted that "
"different platforms may explicitly limit the maximum indentation level."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A formfeed character may be present at the start of the line; it will be "
"ignored for the indentation calculations above.  Formfeed characters "
"occurring elsewhere in the leading whitespace have an undefined effect (for "
"instance, they may reset the space count to zero)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The indentation levels of consecutive lines are used to generate :data:"
"`~token.INDENT` and :data:`~token.DEDENT` tokens, using a stack, as follows."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Before the first line of the file is read, a single zero is pushed on the "
"stack; this will never be popped off again.  The numbers pushed on the stack "
"will always be strictly increasing from bottom to top.  At the beginning of "
"each logical line, the line's indentation level is compared to the top of "
"the stack. If it is equal, nothing happens. If it is larger, it is pushed on "
"the stack, and one :data:`!INDENT` token is generated.  If it is smaller, it "
"*must* be one of the numbers occurring on the stack; all numbers on the "
"stack that are larger are popped off, and for each number popped off a :data:"
"`!DEDENT` token is generated. At the end of the file, a :data:`!DEDENT` "
"token is generated for each number remaining on the stack that is larger "
"than zero."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Here is an example of a correctly (though confusingly) indented piece of "
"Python code::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"def perm(l):\n"
"        # Compute the list of all permutations of l\n"
"    if len(l) <= 1:\n"

msgstr ""

msgid "The following example shows various indentation errors::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
" def perm(l):                       # error: first line indented\n"
"for i in range(len(l)):             # error: not indented\n"

"            return r                # error: inconsistent dedent"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"(Actually, the first three errors are detected by the parser; only the last "
"error is found by the lexical analyzer --- the indentation of ``return r`` "
"does not match a level popped off the stack.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "Whitespace between tokens"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Except at the beginning of a logical line or in string literals, the "
"whitespace characters space, tab and formfeed can be used interchangeably to "
"separate tokens:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Whitespace is needed between two tokens only if their concatenation could "
"otherwise be interpreted as a different token. For example, ``ab`` is one "
"token, but ``a b`` is two tokens. However, ``+a`` and ``+ a`` both produce "
"two tokens, ``+`` and ``a``, as ``+a`` is not a valid token."
msgstr ""

msgid "End marker"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"At the end of non-interactive input, the lexical analyzer generates an :data:"
"`~token.ENDMARKER` token."
msgstr ""

msgid "Other tokens"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Besides :data:`~token.NEWLINE`, :data:`~token.INDENT` and :data:`~token."
"DEDENT`, the following categories of tokens exist: *identifiers* and "
"*keywords* (:data:`~token.NAME`), *literals* (such as :data:`~token.NUMBER` "
"and :data:`~token.STRING`), and other symbols (*operators* and "
"*delimiters*, :data:`~token.OP`). Whitespace characters (other than logical "
"line terminators, discussed earlier) are not tokens, but serve to delimit "
"tokens. Where ambiguity exists, a token comprises the longest possible "
"string that forms a legal token, when read from left to right."
msgstr ""

msgid "Names (identifiers and keywords)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":data:`~token.NAME` tokens represent *identifiers*, *keywords*, and *soft "
"keywords*."
msgstr ""

msgid "Names are composed of the following characters:"
msgstr ""

"names-nonascii` for details."
msgstr ""

msgid "Keywords"
msgstr ""

msgid "``type``, when used in the :keyword:`type` statement."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"These syntactically act as keywords in their specific contexts, but this "

msgid "``type`` is now a soft keyword."
msgstr ""

msgid "Reserved classes of identifiers"
msgstr ""

msgid ""

msgstr ""

msgid "Not imported by ``from module import *``."
msgstr ""

msgid "``_``"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In a ``case`` pattern within a :keyword:`match` statement, ``_`` is a :ref:"
"`soft keyword <soft-keywords>` that denotes a :ref:`wildcard <wildcard-"

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Separately, the interactive interpreter makes the result of the last "
"evaluation available in the variable ``_``. (It is stored in the :mod:"
"`builtins` module, alongside built-in functions like ``print``.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Elsewhere, ``_`` is a regular identifier. It is often used to name "
"\"special\" items, but it is not special to Python itself."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The name ``_`` is often used in conjunction with internationalization; refer "

msgid "``__*__``"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"System-defined names, informally known as \"dunder\" names. These names are "
"defined by the interpreter and its implementation (including the standard "
"library). Current system names are discussed in the :ref:`specialnames` "
"section and elsewhere. More will likely be defined in future versions of "
"Python.  *Any* use of ``__*__`` names, in any context, that does not follow "

msgstr ""

msgid "``__*``"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Class-private names.  Names in this category, when used within the context "
"of a class definition, are re-written to use a mangled form to help avoid "
"name clashes between \"private\" attributes of base and derived classes. See "
"section :ref:`atom-identifiers`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Non-ASCII characters in names"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Names that contain non-ASCII characters need additional normalization and "
"validation beyond the rules and grammar explained :ref:`above "
"<identifiers>`. For example, ``ř_1``, ``蛇``, or ``साँप``  are valid names, "
"but ``r〰2``, ``€``, or ``🐍`` are not."
msgstr ""

msgid "This section explains the exact rules."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"All names are converted into the `normalization form`_ NFKC while parsing. "
"This means that, for example, some typographic variants of characters are "
"converted to their \"basic\" form. For example, ``ﬁⁿₐˡᵢᶻₐᵗᵢᵒₙ`` normalizes "
"to ``finalization``, so Python treats them as the same name::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">>> ﬁⁿₐˡᵢᶻₐᵗᵢᵒₙ = 3\n"
">>> finalization\n"
"3"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Normalization is done at the lexical level only. Run-time functions that "
"take names as *strings* generally do not normalize their arguments. For "
"example, the variable defined above is accessible at run time in the :func:"
"`globals` dictionary as ``globals()[\"finalization\"]`` but not ``globals()"
"[\"ﬁⁿₐˡᵢᶻₐᵗᵢᵒₙ\"]``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Similarly to how ASCII-only names must contain only letters, digits and the "
"underscore, and cannot start with a digit, a valid name must start with a "
"character in the \"letter-like\" set ``xid_start``, and the remaining "
"characters must be in the \"letter- and digit-like\" set ``xid_continue``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"These sets based on the *XID_Start* and *XID_Continue* sets as defined by "
"the Unicode standard annex `UAX-31`_. Python's ``xid_start`` additionally "
"includes the underscore (``_``). Note that Python does not necessarily "
"conform to `UAX-31`_."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A non-normative listing of characters in the *XID_Start* and *XID_Continue* "
"sets as defined by Unicode is available in the `DerivedCoreProperties.txt`_ "
"file in the Unicode Character Database. For reference, the construction "
"rules for the ``xid_*`` sets are given below."
msgstr ""

msgid "The set ``id_start`` is defined as the union of:"

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"\"spam\"\n"
"'eggs'"
msgstr ""

msgid ""

"'Say \"Hello\", please.'\n"
"\"Don't do that!\""
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Except for this limitation, the choice of quote character (``'`` or ``\"``) "
"does not affect how the literal is parsed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Inside a string literal, the backslash (``\\``) character introduces an :dfn:"
"`escape sequence`, which has special meaning depending on the character "

"The following grammar defines :dfn:`operator` and :dfn:`delimiter` tokens, "
"that is, the generic :data:`~token.OP` token type. A :ref:`list of these "
"tokens and their names <token_operators_delimiters>` is also available in "
"the :mod:`!token` module documentation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Generally, *operators* are used to combine :ref:`expressions <expressions>`, "
"while *delimiters* serve other purposes. However, there is no clear, formal "
"distinction between the two categories."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some tokens can serve as either operators or delimiters, depending on usage. "
"For example, ``*`` is both the multiplication operator and a delimiter used "
"for sequence unpacking, and ``@`` is both the matrix multiplication and a "
"delimiter that introduces decorators."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For some tokens, the distinction is unclear. For example, some people "
"consider ``.``, ``(``, and ``)`` to be delimiters, while others see the :py:"
"func:`getattr` operator and the function call operator(s)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some of Python's operators, like ``and``, ``or``, and ``not in``, use :ref:"
"`keyword <keywords>` tokens rather than \"symbols\" (operator tokens)."
