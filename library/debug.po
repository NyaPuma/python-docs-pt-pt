"These libraries help you with Python development: the debugger enables you "
"to step through code, analyze stack frames and set breakpoints etc., and the "
"profilers run code and give you a detailed breakdown of execution times, "
"allowing you to identify bottlenecks in your programs. Auditing events "
"provide visibility into runtime behaviors that would otherwise require "
"intrusive debugging or patching."
